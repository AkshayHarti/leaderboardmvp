# STEPS TO RUN:

1. Run *npm install_all* from the ROOT folder to install all dependencies for client and backend
2. Run *npm start* to start client and server together

##TO CREATE A LOCAL DB (Use credentials or change the DB configuration )

host: "localhost",
user: "root",
password: "root",
database: "leaderboard"

##ASSUMPTIONS
1. The Competitor, Referee and Subscriber are the actors of the system.
1. A Competitor has to register to participate. Once they register, they have to play H2H with every other competitor.
2. The Referee adds the result for an H2H contest. The score submission consists of adding the ID of the competitors and the winner by choosing one of these (competitor #1, competitor #2, draw). Winner is awarded 2 points, a draw gives 1 to each competitor and a loss means no points. This kind of a scoring is created for simplicity and proof of concept.
3. A Subscriber has to register to view the leaderboard. The leaderboard refreshes every 30 seconds and thus provides real time data to the subscriber.

##KEY ASPECTS
1. The Node server consolidates data from tables, competitor and h2h, thus writing it back to leaderboard table. This job happens every 15 seconds
2. The React front end for the subscriber polls for updated leaderboard information every 30 seconds.
